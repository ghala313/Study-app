# Study App
## Summary
    * SmartStudy AI is an application that uses artificial intelligence to help students organize their study time. It prioritizes subjects and generates a daily schedule based on available time and subject difficulty.
## Background
    Students often struggle with: * Difficulty in managing study time * Exam pressure and effort distribution * Distractions and not knowing where to start
     I personally faced this problem during my studies, so I decided to create a solution that helps every student make the best use of their time.
## How is it used? 
     *1. The student enters the subjects and available time. *2. The system suggests a balanced daily plan. *3. Notifications and reminders are sent according to the plan.
     Main users: school and university students.
    Data sources and AI methods • Data: subjects, exam schedules, and available study time. • AI methods: optimization algorithms + machine learning to adapt to the student’s patterns and suggest personalized plans. Data source Calendar data User input (subjects, schedule) Use Create study plan Align reminders ##Challenges • Cannot guarantee that students will follow the plan. • Requires accurate and honest data input. • Some personal circumstances are not reflected in the data.
## What next? 
    • Add recommendations for study techniques depending on the subject (e.g. quick review, mind maps). • Integrate with calendar apps such as Google Calendar. • Build a model that learns from student performance and improves the plan over time.
